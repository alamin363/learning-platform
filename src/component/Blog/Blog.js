      ans: "Itâ€™s important to note that this convenient way of divvying up development has changed significantly over the past 10 to 15 years with the explosive growth of JavaScript, which wasnâ€™t as ubiquitous on the front end as it is now, or as common on the back end, thanks to Node.js. Thereâ€™s more overlap between the two, especially when it comes to a JavaScript developerâ€™s role on a fully JavaScript-powered stack.",

Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient. ðŸ§Ÿ Working of Node.js: Node.js accepts the request from the clients and sends the response, while working with the request node.js handles them with a single thread. To operate I/O operations or requests node.js use the concept of threads. Thread is a sequence of instructions that the server needs to perform. It runs parallel on the server to provide the information to multiple clients. Node.js is an event loop single-threaded language. It can handle concurrent requests with a single thread without blocking it for one request. ",
